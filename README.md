## description

***

This is an assignment to create a portfolio page of our own without any starter codebase given. The layout of the<br>
work was envisioned through wireframe diagrams first and the container tags were assigned accordingly. The codebase<br>
was semantically organized and accessibility concepts were addressed. It is employing several new tools like flexbox,<br>
media queries, pseudo elements, CSS variables and absolute positioning. This work was completed by using HTML and<br>
CSS coding. Best viewed at full screen, 16:10 aspect ratio.<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:
* WHEN I load their portfolio; THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to<br>
sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation; THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work; THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of<br>
the developer's applications.
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application; THEN that application's image should be larger<br>
in size than the others.
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications; THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices; THEN I am presented with a responsive<br>
layout that adapts to my viewport.
