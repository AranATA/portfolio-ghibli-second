            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill Boot Camp, in the "Full Stack Flex Program". Spread over 24 weeks, this program focuses on teaching the required knowledge and skills to build dynamic, end-to-end web applications. Upon completion, scheduled for July 21, 2021, the program will award a professional certificate to entitle each graduate as a "Full Stack Web Developer".
                <br>                
                <br>
                This particular portfolio page displays examples of the work that I have completed so far in the program after 9 weeks of rigorous learning and will be updated regularly to include more advanced work. The main topics which I covered during this period includes: HTML, Git, CSS, Javascript, Web-APIs, Third-Party-APIs and Server-Side-APIs.      
                <br>                
                <br>
                I am an architect and prior to my involvement in coding I mostly worked on residential projects both in the US and overseas. I enjoyed taking responsibilities not only in the design phase but also on the construction end as well. My career also let me supervise the design and manufacturing processes simultaneously while I partnered with a boat builder to build custom-designed sailboats to offer the comfort of a home. 
                <br>                
                <br>                
                Whenever I had the opportunity, I took positions in higher education. I taught architectural design at different universities for several years. Teaching and the academic environment enabled me to form interdisciplinary ties with other creative minds and broaden my knowledge. Utilizing computers through softwares like AutoCAD, SketchUp, Rhino, Photoshop or 3DS Max was always essential in architectural practice. However, it was through my affiliation with the schools that I was introduced to the concepts of algorithmic thinking and parametric design as applicable design methods in architecture.
                <br>                
                <br>
                All along my professional life, I took great advantage of my critical thinking skills, attention to details and commitment to success. Now, I like to continue manifesting my potential as a "Web Developer" and I am really excited!

<!-- When image tags were left on their own inside the figure container, there were issues of handling the flexbox and aligning them with the H2 container even though the figure container was the parent. Once they were placed in div containers, those problems were solved. The second div to hold the H4 and P was required to apply "absolute" positioning. -->
